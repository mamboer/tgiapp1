ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* LICENSE
* LICENSE.txt
* README.md
* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets/
* libs/Android_SDK_v1.2_Fix.jar => app/libs/Android_SDK_v1.2_Fix.jar
* libs/commons-httpclient-3.1.jar => app/libs/commons-httpclient-3.1.jar
* libs/cordova-3.4.0.jar => app/libs/cordova-3.4.0.jar
* libs/httpmime-4.1.3.jar => app/libs/httpmime-4.1.3.jar
* libs/libammsdk.jar => app/libs/libammsdk.jar
* libs/zxing.jar => app/libs/zxing.jar
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
